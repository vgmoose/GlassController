In this directory are example configuration files, which can be imported into the UI.

The `Fingerpad` configuration creates 4 regions to control the arrow keys, to mimic the functionality in [fpad2](https://github.com/vgmoose/fpad2).

The `Custom` profile has a few enhancements over the regular macOS UI, such as Five finger swipe closing windows, Four up/down for app expose / mission control (oppposite of what the System UI lets you set)
